## pycollege
Originally, this repo had small programs, I've written in Python which I used for a college degree. But then I filled it with small scripts I was doing in self-educational purposes.

We had a great focus on tkinter in college. I don't like this lib, but it is what it is

Currently it has:
1. Discriminant calculator
2. Terminal calculator
3. Two versions of calculator made in TKinter framework
4. Calculator of primitives geometrical shapes 
5. A program which determines your location by your IP Address
6. A simple parking program, written with TKinter
